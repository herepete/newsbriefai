    <p class="tldr">In brief — South Korea&#39;s KT Telecom has faced scrutiny after a security failure involving thousands of poorly secured femtocells, leading to customer fraud and communication snooping.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The breach highlights vulnerabilities in telecommunications infrastructure, potentially affecting millions of users.</li>
<li>It raises concerns about the adequacy of security measures in consumer technology.</li>
<li>Such incidents can undermine public trust in telecom providers and their ability to protect user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT has reported significant security issues with KT Telecom's deployment of femtocells, small cellular base stations designed to improve mobile coverage. The investigation revealed that these devices were equipped with a single security certificate stored in plaintext, making them susceptible to exploitation. This vulnerability has reportedly allowed malicious actors to engage in micropayments fraud and eavesdrop on customer communications for an extended period, potentially years. The incident underscores the critical need for robust security protocols in telecommunications, especially as reliance on mobile technology increases. With millions of users affected, the implications of such breaches extend beyond financial loss to include serious concerns about privacy and data protection. As telecom companies continue to innovate and expand their services, ensuring the security of their infrastructure must be a top priority to maintain consumer trust and safeguard against future attacks.

    <p class="tldr">In brief — The UK’s largest accounting body, ACCA, will end remote exams due to rising concerns over AI-assisted cheating.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ACCA&#39;s decision reflects growing worries about integrity in professional qualifications.</li>
<li>This move could impact thousands of students who rely on online assessments.</li>
<li>It highlights the ongoing challenges of regulating AI technologies in education.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has announced that it will no longer permit remote exams for its students, effective March 2025, except in exceptional circumstances. This decision comes in response to an increase in cheating facilitated by AI technologies. The ACCA, which boasts nearly 260,000 members, aims to uphold the integrity of its qualifications by ensuring that assessments are conducted in person. This shift underscores a broader concern within educational and professional institutions about the implications of AI on academic honesty and the potential for misuse. As AI tools become more sophisticated, regulatory bodies are grappling with how to adapt their policies to maintain fairness and credibility in assessments. The ACCA's decision may set a precedent for other professional organizations facing similar challenges.
