    <div class="explainer">
      The case involving Coupang, a prominent Korean e-commerce platform, serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with insider threats in data security. A former employee allegedly accessed sensitive information pertaining to 33 million customers, which could lead to significant privacy breaches if misused. The accused reportedly took drastic measures to cover up the crime by disposing of the MacBook that contained the data. This incident not only raises questions about the effectiveness of Coupang's internal security protocols but also emphasizes the need for companies to implement stringent safeguards and regular audits to protect sensitive customer information. As data breaches become increasingly common, organizations must remain vigilant against both external and internal threats to maintain trust and compliance with data protection regulations.

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      Ubisoft's popular game, Rainbow Six Siege, faced a severe security breach that led to the shutdown of its servers and marketplace. Hackers gained unauthorized access to the game's systems, allowing them to issue bans, unlock all in-game items, and distribute a staggering 2 billion R6 Credits to players. This virtual currency has a real-world value of approximately $13.33 million, based on Ubisoft's pricing structure. The company has taken immediate action to contain the situation by shutting down all servers across PC and consoles while they work to resolve the breach. Such incidents underscore the ongoing challenges that gaming companies face in securing their platforms against cyber threats. The outcome of this situation could impact player trust and Ubisoft's reputation in the long run.
