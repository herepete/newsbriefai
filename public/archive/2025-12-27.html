    <p class="tldr">In brief — Corporate security leaders are increasingly conducting tabletop exercises to prepare for potential cyberattacks as part of their year-end reviews.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tabletop exercises help organizations simulate and practice responses to cyber incidents.</li>
<li>These exercises are crucial for improving incident response processes and ensuring preparedness.</li>
<li>As cyber threats evolve, proactive measures like these are essential for organizational security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      Tabletop exercises are strategic simulations where corporate security teams role-play responses to hypothetical cyber incidents. These exercises allow organizations to identify gaps in their incident response plans and improve their overall security posture. By simulating scenarios such as data breaches or ransomware attacks, teams can practice coordination and communication, ensuring that everyone knows their responsibilities during a real crisis. The end of the year is a common time for these exercises, as companies reflect on their security measures and prepare for potential threats in the upcoming year. With cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated, such proactive measures are vital for minimizing risks and safeguarding sensitive information.

    <p class="tldr">In brief — In 2025, heat waves significantly impacted power grids globally, prompting interest in innovative cooling technologies like radiative cooling paints and coatings.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Heat waves are becoming more frequent due to climate change, straining energy resources.</li>
<li>Innovative cooling solutions could reduce reliance on traditional air conditioning systems.</li>
<li>The development of new materials may offer sustainable alternatives to combat rising temperatures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      The summer of 2025 saw extreme heat waves that disrupted power grids across North America, Europe, and the Middle East. As global temperatures rise, the demand for air conditioning increases, which in turn places additional stress on already strained electrical systems. Traditional air conditioning relies heavily on electricity, leading to higher energy consumption and potential outages during peak demand times. In response to this challenge, researchers and innovators are exploring alternative cooling methods, such as radiative cooling technologies. These include specialized paints and coatings designed to reflect sunlight and dissipate heat, thereby reducing the need for conventional air conditioning. By utilizing these advanced materials, it may be possible to create cooler environments without the high energy costs associated with traditional cooling methods. This shift not only addresses immediate energy concerns but also aligns with broader sustainability goals as society seeks to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

    <p class="tldr">In brief — Microsoft has open-sourced the classic text adventure game Zork, prompting reflections on the challenges of using AI chatbots in 2025.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The open-sourcing of Zork highlights a trend towards making classic games more accessible.</li>
<li>The comparison between text adventure games and AI chatbots underscores user frustrations with current AI technology.</li>
<li>This development may influence future AI design by drawing parallels with gaming experiences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      Microsoft’s decision to open-source Zork, a foundational text adventure game, has sparked discussions about the user experience of AI chatbots in 2025. Many users have found interacting with chatbots reminiscent of the frustrating elements of old text adventure games, where players often faced unclear instructions and dead ends. This comparison raises important questions about the usability and effectiveness of current AI technologies. As AI continues to evolve, understanding user frustrations can guide better design and functionality, potentially leading to more intuitive and satisfying interactions. The move to open-source Zork may encourage developers to reflect on the user experience in both gaming and AI, aiming to create tools that are not only powerful but also user-friendly.

    <p class="tldr">In brief — French insect farming startup Ÿnsect has entered judicial liquidation after raising over $600 million, highlighting challenges in the sector.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ÿnsect&#39;s failure underscores the financial risks associated with innovative agricultural startups.</li>
<li>The company&#39;s insolvency raises questions about the sustainability of insect farming as a business model.</li>

    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <div class="explainer">
      Ÿnsect, a French startup focused on insect farming, recently faced judicial liquidation due to insolvency, despite securing over $600 million in funding. The company aimed to revolutionize food production and sustainability by farming insects for animal feed and other uses. However, the challenges of scaling operations and market acceptance have proven significant hurdles. The insect farming sector has been touted as a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture, but Ÿnsect's downfall raises concerns about its viability and the financial risks involved. Investors may now be more cautious about funding similar startups, which could slow innovation in this emerging field. The situation serves as a reminder that even well-funded companies can struggle to find a sustainable path in rapidly evolving markets.
